## What Was Configured

### Backend Changes
- Added PostgreSQL support to `build.gradle`
- Created `application-prod.properties` for production configuration
- Updated CORS to use environment variables
- Added Railway configuration files (`railway.json`, `Procfile`, `system.properties`)

### Frontend Changes
- Created `.env.production` for production API URL
- Added Vercel configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Added Netlify configuration (`netlify.toml`) as alternative

### Database
- Development: H2 in-memory database (localhost)
- Production: PostgreSQL (Railway/Supabase/Neon)
- Data seeding works automatically on startup via `CommandLineRunner`

## Files Modified

- `build.gradle` - Added PostgreSQL dependency
- `CorsConfig.java` - Made CORS configurable via environment variables
- `.gitignore` - Added environment files and build directories

## Next Steps

Choose your deployment path:

### Option A: Follow Complete Guide (Recommended for First Time)
1. Read [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Follow each step carefully
3. Takes ~10-15 minutes total

### Option B: Quick Deployment (If You're Familiar with Git/Cloud)
1. Read [DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md](DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md)
2. Execute the 5-minute deployment
3. Perfect for quick setup

## Key Environment Variables

### Backend (Railway)
```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
DATABASE_URL=<auto-generated-by-railway>
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
PORT=8080
```

### Frontend (Vercel)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api
```

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:

1. **Backend Health Check**:
   ```
   https://your-backend.railway.app/api/departments
   ```
   Should return JSON with department data

2. **Frontend**:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```
   Should display the React UI

3. **Full Integration**:
   - Create a new department
   - Create a new professor
   - View department with professors
   - Update and delete records

## Troubleshooting Resources

All common issues and solutions are documented in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting)

Quick fixes:
- **CORS errors**: Check `FRONTEND_URL` matches exactly
- **404 errors**: Verify environment variables in Vercel
- **Database errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL is linked in Railway
- **Build failures**: Check logs in Railway/Vercel dashboards

## Important Notes

1. **First deployment takes longer** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Subsequent deployments are automatic** when you push to GitHub
3. **Free tiers have limitations**:
   - Railway: 500 hours/month (plenty for a school project)
   - Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
   - Database: 500MB storage

4. **No credit card required** for any service!

## Support

- Railway: https://railway.app/help
- Vercel: https://vercel.com/support
- Project Issues: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting)

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Backend API returns data at `/api/departments`
- ✅ Frontend loads without errors
- ✅ You can perform all CRUD operations
- ✅ Data persists after backend restart
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console

## Submission for Your Teacher

After successful deployment, document these URLs:

- **Live Application**: https://________.vercel.app
- **API Endpoint**: https://________.railway.app/api
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/______/UniversityDepartmentSystem

Include screenshots of:
1. Working frontend
2. API response (departments endpoint)
3. Railway dashboard showing successful deployment
4. Vercel dashboard showing successful deployment
